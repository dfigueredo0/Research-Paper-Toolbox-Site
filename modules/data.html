            <p>
                This short lesson is intended for graduate and advanced undergraduate students undertaking original
                research
                projects. After completing the 30-minute lesson, you will be able to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Format raw research data in an Excel spreadsheet for efficient analysis</li>
                <li>Run basic descriptive statistics in Excel</li>
                <li>Prepare the documents for statistical analysis in the software package PASW</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Format Data for Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                Make sure the computer you are working on has Microsoft Excel installed. Open the document
                <a href="../src/assets/docs/tutorial_spreadsheet.xlsx" download>ToolBox_Datalesson.xlsx</a> in
                Excel and
                follow
                along wit the
                lesson, taking action as instructed.
            </p>
            <p>In the Raw_Dataset spreadsheet, the name of each variable has been entered in the first row of each
                column.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Each variable name must be different from other variable names</li>
                <li>The first variable (in Column A) is a <strong>unique identifier.</strong></li>
                <li>Variable names must start with a letter (not numbers or special characters), so change
                    <em>4tutorial_types</em> to <em>tutorial_types</em>.
                </li>
                <li>Name variables so that they are intuitive to you. Therefore, change use and useful to
                    <em>perc_ease_of_use</em> and <em>perc_usefulness</em>, respectively.
                </li>
                <li>Your spreadsheet should look like Figure 1, and it should now be readily apparent that Column F
                    refers to
                    <em>Perceived Usefulness</em> and Column G refers to <em>Perceived Ease of Use</em>.
                </li>
            </ol>

                <figcaption>Tutorial type, gender, experience, and task categorical values have been formatted as
                    dichotomous
                    variables.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Data values, or rows have been input for each subject in the experiment</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Decide on input conventions and stick to them. In <em>gender</em>, change the "female" value to "F".
                </li>
                <li>Separate data into component values whenever possible by adding new columns. For example,
                    tasks_completed
                    values (Y/Y/N) can be broken up into three components. So, add columns <em>task1, task2</em>, and
                    <em>task3</em>, and reformat values appropriately.
                </li>
                <li>Double-check to ensure no data entry errors have been made, then delete the old
                    <em>tasks_completed</em>
                    column.
                </li>
                <li>Your Raw_Dataset spreadsheet should now look like Figure 2.</li>
            </ol>

                <figcaption>Values for each variable are entered in a consisten format.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                Replace categorical data values with "0" or "1" (0=no, 1=yes) to indicate whether or not the value is
                represented for
                the given subject/item. This makes the categorical values dichotomous, which gives the researcher
                maximum
                flexibility in
                testing for relationships or correlations.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Copy the Raw_Dataset values into the Sheet2 tab. Rename this sheet Formatted_Data.</li>
                <li>In the Formatted_Data sheet, add new columns with Insert &gt; Columns for each distinct value in
                    categorical
                    data columns <em>(tutorial_types, gender, exp_level, task1, task2</em>, and <em>task3</em>). You do
                    not have
                    to add a new column for <em>task1, task2</em>, and <em>task3</em> because their values are already
                    dichotomous.</li>
                <li>Rename columns according to each possible categorical value. Copy and paste the values from the
                    original
                    column.</li>
                <li>Replace dichotomous data values with "0" or "1" (0=no, 1=yes) using the replace function: Edit &gt;
                    Replace.
                </li>
                <li>Your Formatted_Data spreadsheet should now look like Figure 3.</li>

                <h3>Why dichotomous variables?</h3>
                <p>
                    Dichotomous variables allow for the easy isolation of characteristics for analysis. For example,
                    separating
                    experience
                    levels allows the researcher to test in PASW whether subjects with low experience have perceived
                    ease of use
                    scores
                    significantly different from those with medium and high experience levels.
                </p>
            </aside>

            <h2>Run Descriptive Statistics</h2>

            <aside class="callout" aria-label="Interpreting descriptives">
                <h3>Interpreting descriptives</h3>
                <p>
                    Analyzing descriptive statistics may lead you to ask new questions. For example, perc_enjoy is much
                    higher on
                    average
                    than perc_usefulness, which also has a large variance. This suggests that a segment of users may not
                    have
                    considered the
                    system useful even though they enjoyed using it.
                </p>
            </aside>

            <p>
                Run descriptive (summary) statistics on the dataset and output results in a new spreadsheet. If
                necessary,
                rearrange
                columns so that data requiring summary, those with continuous values, are adjacent. (In the spreadsheet,
                the
                continuous
                values of <em>perc_enjoy, perc_usefulness</em>, and <em>perc_ease_of_use</em> are already adjacent.)
            </p>
            <p>Write down the "input range" (i.e. H2:J26) of the data requiring summary, making sure not to include
                variable
                labels.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Go to Tools &gt; Add-Ins... and make sure Analysis ToolPak is checked. Click OK.</li>
                <li>Go to Tools &gt; Data Analysis and select Descriptive Statistics. Click OK.</li>
                <li>Enter the input range in the blank and check Summary Statistics. Click OK.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                The descriptive statistics summary will output in a new sheet. Rename this spreadsheet
                Descriptive_Stats. Label
                the
                output according to the variables. For example, <em>Column 1</em> should be <em>perc_enjoy</em>. Your
                Descriptive_Stats
                spreadsheet should now look like Figure 4.
            </p>
            <p>
                Analyzing descriptive statistics is a great way to start appraising a dataset before running inferential
                statistics.
                What insights about the dataset can you glean from the summary statistics for <em>perc_usefulness</em>
                and
                <em>perc_ease_of_use</em>?

                    lables must
                    be re-entered.</figcaption>

            <h2>Run Inferential Statistics</h2>
            <p>
                Open PASW and upload the spreadsheet. (IIT labs in Stuart Building, room 112, have PASW. You can also
                download a
                30-day
                free trial.)
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>When PASW starts, it will prompt you for a data source. Select Open an existing data source &gt;

                <li>Set the file type to Excel, then find and open the file.</li>
                <li>From the list, select the Formatted_Data worksheet. Click OK. You should now see the dataset.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The most commonly used statistical methods and tests are found under the <strong>Analyze</strong> menu in
                the
                standard toolbar.</p>
            <p>Figure 5 shows where to find some common statistical methods and tests. Under PASW's Analyze menu, see if
                you
                can also find the following:</p>

                <p>
                    You should have determined that the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance is the appropriate
                    test. Go to

                Because statistical analysis output contains many numerical components (some of which must be cited in
                formal
                reports),
                it is a good idea to save it to a format independent of the PASW software. To save the results, go to
                File &gt;
                Export.
                Change Document Type to the desired output format (Word, Excel, PDF, etc.), then click OK.
